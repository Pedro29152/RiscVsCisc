# RISC vs CISC
## Overview
Risc vs Cisc is a brief exemplification of overengineering for simple tasks, like making a simple mathematical operation.
The idea of this experiment is to show that sometimes, the best solution for a problem is also the most simple.
The name "Risc vs Cisc" comes from the CPU architectures, Cisc being the one with more complex operations but takes more cycles to complete while Risk uses simpler operations that take only once cycle. Although Risk being less complex than Cisc, it can use more cycles to reproduce operations from the Cisc one, so it does not loose functionality when compared to Cisc.
